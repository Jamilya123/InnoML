##Announcements

* Please fill [anonymous feedback form about the course](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1whqK0jbsp7fSLpXmyt1AtLFaPugczOBx_imuBVjFTaw/viewform)
* Please join the newly created group of all students who graduated from my machine learning course in [vkontakte](https://vk.com/ml_alumni).
* If you want to improve your grades, you can participate in some [active kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions) and before 23:59 May 17 send me presentation with your solution and code. Your grade will be increased (C->B, B->A) if I see that you worked thourougly with data, specifically if I see in your presentation:
  * your best algorithm
  * alternative algorithms that you tried
  * your best set of features
  * other kinds of features that you tried
  * interesting visualizations about the data or algorithm performance.
  * your reasoning why some approaches worked and other - didn't
* Participation in kaggle competition I suggest in the following way - you select a "supervisor" from those students, who received >89% score and use their advice. Hovewer, its their right, not obligation to help you, because they already have A grade.
